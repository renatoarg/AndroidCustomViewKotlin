# AndroidCustomViewKotlin
Simple Android application with a custom view

In this app there is a custom view which is a merge of an EditText and a Button.

When the user types something in the EditText and hits the Button, the view sends a callBack to the Activity with the text typed.

Finally, the text is inserted in a RecyclerView.

Code 100% Kotlin
